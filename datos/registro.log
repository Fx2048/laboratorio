The Netherlands,[k] informally Holland, is a 
country in Northwestern Europe, with overseas
 territories in the Caribbean. It is the largest
 of the four constituent countries of the Kingdom 
of the Netherlands.[13] The Netherlands consists 
of twelve provinces; it borders Germany to the east
 and Belgium to the south, with a North Sea coastline
 to the north and west. It shares maritime borders with
 the United Kingdom,
 Germany, and Belgium.[14]
 The official language is Dutch,
 with West Frisian as a secondary official language
 in the province of Friesland.[1]
 Dutch, English, and Papiamento are official
 in the Caribbean territories.[1]

Netherlands literally means "lower countries"
 in reference to its low elevation and flat topography,
 with 26% below sea level.[15]
 Most of the areas below sea level,
 known as polders, are the result of land reclamation
 that began in the 14th century.[16] In the Republican period, which began in 1588, the Netherlands entered a unique era of political, economic, and cultural greatness, ranked among the most powerful and influential in Europe and the world; this period is known as the Dutch Golden Age.[17] During this time, its trading companies, the Dutch East India Company and the Dutch West India Company, established colonies and trading posts all over the world.[18][19]

With a population of over 18 million people, all living within a total area of 41,850 km2 (16,160 sq mi)—of which the land area is 33,500 km2 (12,900 sq mi)—the Netherlands is the 33rd most densely populated country, with a density of 535 people per square kilometre (1,390 people/sq mi). Nevertheless, it is the world
's second-largest exporter of food and agricultural products by value,
 owing to its fertile
 soil, mild climate,
